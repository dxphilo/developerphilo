âœ¨ I'm a frontend Developer and technical writer passionate about making the web accessible to everyone through open-source projects. 

Iâ€™m also a big advocate for building open and inclusive communities. I'm a community-organizer at [VuejsKenya](https://twitter.com/kenyavue).

I love sharing my knowledge with others, and I do that through content creation on my Blog and ocassionaly on my YouTube channel.When I'm not coding, you can find me chatting about soccer.
